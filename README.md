## General Info
- This project is part of Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering path.
- The random message that is generated is a random character build for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
- The character has random:
  - Morality
  - Gender
  - Race
  - Two primary skills
  - Three secondary skills
    - Weapons and destruction magic skills are given a specific class (axes, frost etc.)

## Technologies
- JavaScript / ECMAScript 2020
- Node - v16.13.1

## Setup
- Ensure that you have Node.js and downloaded and installed beforehand.
- Choose a local directory where the files will be stored, and then use the GitBash terminal navigate to the directory:
```
$ cd yourDirectory
```
- Alternatively create one first:
```
$ mkdir yourDirectory
$ cd yourDirectory
```
- Then simply copy the following code and paste into the terminal:
```
$ git clone ...
$ cd skyrimBuildRandomiser
```
## Launch
- To generate a new character build, simply run the below command in the terminal:
```
$ node script.js
```
- If the build doesn't sound any fun, you can run the generator again by using the above command until you're happy with the character.

## Status
Project is: *finished*.

## Inspiration
I often come back to play Skyrim and have long since burned through my own list of character builds to try out. 

This generator is a handy way to provide build suggestions to play and adds an extra layer of challenge to the character: good luck making a character work that uses Speech and Block as primary skills!
